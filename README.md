# Sticky Noter

Sticky Noter is a Chrome extension that allows you to create sticky notes on any website*.

Currently in alpha, but should be more or less usable.

You can click the extension icon to create a sticky note.

I recommend setting a keyboard shortcut for it. I have it set to `Command+Shift+K` on macOS and `Ctrl+Shift+K` on Windows.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner.
4. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the folder where you cloned the repository.

\*for whatever other web specification type of reason :)
